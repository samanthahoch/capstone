# Northeastern Senior Capstone - The Role of Data Science in Smart Cities

This GitHub repository contains the data analysis and corresponding report for my senior capstone. 

## Abstract

Smart cities are an innovative approach to environmental planning and sustainability that rely on Internet of Things (IoT) devices or other technology to collect data about the city. This paper examines two possible applications of smart city technology in smart energy grids and transportation networks, as well as the challenges that come with implementing this highly integrated technology. Any data collected by smart cities is then analyzed for use by the government to make informed decisions about policy and city planning. Governments can also learn from cities that have already begun implementing smart city technologies today. Additionally, when developing a plan for a smart city, one must consider the demand for data scientists to uphold data integrity and provide analyses. There are many possibilities for tools and techniques to use during data analysis, so this paper explores an example analysis of bike share data using Tableau and Python.
